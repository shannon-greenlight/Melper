# The Melper
The Melper converts a Moog case into a powered Eurorack case.

It requires +12V as an input and generates -12V and +5V.

These 3 voltage rails supply 6 Eurorack power connectors.

Three LEDs monitor the supply rails.  

It is targeted to Moog cases, but can be used in any case that has +12V.

Typically, a 12 volt wall wart like the one that Moog supplies is used.
